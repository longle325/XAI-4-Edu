The task is to determine whether the value of the conclusion/question is Yes, No, or Uncertain based on the premises.


Please solve the question step by step, using the provided inference rules. During each step, indicate which rule you used and explain your reasoning in natural language. If you use a premise or a previously derived conclusion, specify it clearly (e.g., "From Premise 1 and Step 3").

### Example 1

**Premises**:
1. If a student completes all required courses, they are eligible for graduation.
2. If a student is eligible for graduation and has a GPA above 3.5, they graduate with honors.
3. If a student graduates with honors and completes a thesis, they receive academic distinction.
4. If a student receives academic distinction, they qualify for a fellowship.
5. John completed all required courses.
6. John has a GPA above 3.5.
7. John completed a thesis.

**Question**: Does John receive academic distinction?

**Execution**:

**Step 1**: Identify the goal. We need to determine if "John receives academic distinction" is true based on the premises.

**Step 2**: Use Premise 5: "John completed all required courses." From Premise 1: "If a student completes all required courses, they are eligible for graduation." By **If-Then Elimination (Modus Ponens)**, since John completed the courses, he is eligible for graduation.

**Step 3**: Use Premise 6: "John has a GPA above 3.5." From Step 2, John is eligible for graduation. By **And Introduction**, we have "John is eligible for graduation and has a GPA above 3.5." From Premise 2: "If a student is eligible for graduation and has a GPA above 3.5, they graduate with honors." By **If-Then Elimination (Modus Ponens)**, John graduates with honors.

**Step 4**: Use Premise 7: "John completed a thesis." From Step 3, John graduates with honors. By **And Introduction**, "John graduates with honors and completed a thesis." From Premise 3: "If a student graduates with honors and completes a thesis, they receive academic distinction." By **If-Then Elimination (Modus Ponens)**, John receives academic distinction.

**Step 5**: Conclude. Since we derived "John receives academic distinction," the answer is true.

```
Final answer: Yes
idx: [1,2,3,5,6,7]
explanation: Academic distinction per premise 3 requires graduating with honors and completing a thesis. Premise 2 requires graduation eligibility and a GPA above 3.5, and premise 1 requires course completion. Premises 5–7 confirm John’s course completion, GPA of 3.8, and thesis, satisfying all conditions for academic distinction.

### Example 2

**Premises**:
1. All students who complete the required courses are eligible for graduation.
2. Some students who are eligible for graduation have a GPA above 3.5.
3. No student with a GPA above 3.5 fails the final exam.
4. John is a student who completed the required courses.
5. John has a GPA above 3.5.

**Question**: Did John pass the final exam?

**Execution**:

**Step 1**: Identify the goal. We need to determine if "John passed the final exam" is true, false, or unknown.


**Step 2**: Use Premise 5: "John has a GPA above 3.5." From Premise 3: "No student with a GPA above 3.5 fails the final exam." Since John has a GPA above 3.5, he did not fail the final exam.

**Step 3**: Interpret "not failing." In common usage, "not failing" the final exam means passing it, assuming a pass/fail dichotomy unless otherwise specified. The premises don’t suggest otherwise.

**Step 4**: Conclude. Since John did not fail the final exam, he passed it based on the premises.

```
Final answer: Yes
idx: [3,5]
explanation: From Premise 5 and Premise 3, since John has a GPA above 3.5 and no student with such a GPA fails the final exam, John did not fail the final exam. Assuming a pass/fail system, this means John passed the final exam.

### Solve the Following

- These are the Context (premises) and the question you need to solve:
   **Context**:  [[CONTEXT]]

   **Question**: [[QUESTION]]
- Here is the detailed plan that helps you solve question:
   **Plan**: [[PLAN]]

- Make sure you carefully follow the requirements:
   1. Indicate the answer as {Yes/No/Uncertain} based on the definitions provided.
      - Yes: The conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.
      - No: The conclusion is contradicted by the premises or its negation is inferred.
      - Uncertain: Insufficient information to determine the conclusion’s truth value.
   2. Use only the premises to infer the conclusion. Do not introduce external information.
   3. For conditional conclusions (e.g., "If P, then Q"), treat the antecedent as a premise and prioritize it over conflicting premises.
   4. Clearly indicate which premises or prior steps you use in each inference.
   5. Explain each step in natural language, referencing the premises or steps used.


After your reasoning, provide the final answer in the format:
```
Final answer: {Yes/No/Uncertain}
idx: [list of premise indices used]
explanation: A brief summary of your reasoning in natural language (1-2 sentences). You should include the premises used for the inference.
