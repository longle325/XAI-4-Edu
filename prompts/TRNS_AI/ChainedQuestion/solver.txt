The task is to olving chained questions based on given premises using natural language reasoning. You will be provided with a set of premises and a chained question. A chained question will consist of two parts. The parts can be:
- One requiring a numerical answer and the other a Yes/No/Uncertain answer.
- Both requiring numerical answers.
- Both requiring Yes/No/Uncertain answers.
Your task is to carefully analyze the premises and use logical inference to answer both parts of the question step by step. The second part of the question may depend on the answer to the first part, or they might be independently solvable from the premises. Use only the information provided in the premises, and explain your reasoning clearly.
----- 

You must refer to the following inference rules when making logical deductions. These rules guide how to draw conclusions from given statements in natural language:

1. If-Then Elimination (Modus Ponens): If "If P, then Q" is true and "P" is true, then "Q" is true.
2. Denying the Consequent (Modus Tollens): If "If P, then Q" is true and "Q" is false, then "P" is false.
3. For All (Universal Instantiation): If "All X are P" is true, then "C is P" is true for any specific C.
4. For All Introduction: If "P" is true for every specific C, you can infer "All X are P".
5. There Exists (Existential Instantiation): If "Some X are P" is true, you can infer "C is P" for some specific C.
6. There Exists Introduction: If "C is P" is true for some specific C, you can infer "Some X are P".
7. And Introduction: If "P" is true and "Q" is true, you can infer "P and Q".
8. And Elimination: From "P and Q", you can infer "P" and also infer "Q".
9. Or Introduction: If "P" is true, you can infer "P or Q". Similarly, if "Q" is true, infer "P or Q".
10. Or Elimination: From "P or Q" and "not P", infer "Q". Similarly, from "P or Q" and "not Q", infer "P".
11. If and Only If Introduction: If "If P, then Q" and "If Q, then P" are both true, infer "P if and only if Q".
12. If and Only If Elimination: From "P if and only if Q", infer "If P, then Q" and "If Q, then P".
13. Negation Introduction (Reductio ad Absurdum): If assuming "not P" leads to a contradiction, infer "P".
14. Negation Elimination: If "not not P" is true, infer "P".
15. Hypothetical Syllogism: If "If P, then Q" and "If Q, then R" are both true, then "If P, then R" is true.
16. Disjunctive Syllogism: If "P or Q" is true and "not P" is true, then "Q" is true. Similarly, if "P or Q" is true and "not Q" is true, then "P" is true.

Please solve the question step by step, using the provided inference rules. During each step, indicate which rule you used and explain your reasoning in natural language. If you use a premise or a previously derived conclusion, specify it clearly (e.g., "From Premise 1 and Step 3").

After your reasoning, provide the final answer in the format:

```
Final answer: <answer_part1>, <answer_part2>
idx: [list of premise indices used for both parts]
explanation: A brief summary of your reasoning for both parts in natural language, referencing premise numbers.
```

Where <answer_part1> and <answer_part2> can be:
- <number>, Yes/No/Uncertain
- <number>, <number> (if the question asks for two numerical values, include currency symbols like $ if appropriate for each)
- Yes/No/Uncertain, Yes/No/Uncertain

Ensure your reasoning uses only the given premises and adheres to the inference rules. If a question part involves a conditional statement, treat the antecedent as a premise and prioritize it over conflicting premises.

### Example 1 (Student Costs & Performance - Two Numerical)

Premises:
1. Course Alpha costs $500.
2. Course Beta costs $600.
3. A student, Alex, enrolls in Course Alpha and Course Beta.
4. Alex receives a 10% scholarship on the total cost of enrolled courses.
5. Alex scores 85 points in Course Alpha.
6. Alex scores 92 points in Course Beta.
7. The average score is calculated as the sum of scores divided by the number of courses.

Question:
What is Alex's total course cost after the scholarship, and what is Alex's average score?

Execution:
Step 1: Understand the Question
- First part: Calculate Alex's total course cost after scholarship (numerical, currency).
- Second part: Calculate Alex's average score (numerical).

Step 2: Calculate Total Course Cost Before Scholarship
- Cost of Course Alpha: $500 (From Premise 1).
- Cost of Course Beta: $600 (From Premise 2).
- Alex enrolls in both (From Premise 3).
- Total cost before scholarship: $500 + $600 = $1100.

Step 3: Calculate Scholarship Amount and Final Cost
- Scholarship percentage: 10% (From Premise 4).
- Scholarship amount: $1100 * 0.10 = $110.
- Total cost after scholarship: $1100 - $110 = $990.

Step 4: Calculate Average Score
- Score in Course Alpha: 85 points (From Premise 5).
- Score in Course Beta: 92 points (From Premise 6).
- Number of courses: 2.
- Sum of scores: 85 + 92 = 177 points.
- Average score: 177 / 2 = 88.5 points (Using Premise 7).

Final answer: $990, 88.5
idx: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
explanation: Alex's total cost for Course Alpha (Premise 1: $500) and Course Beta (Premise 2: $600) is $1100 (Premise 3). A 10% scholarship (Premise 4) reduces this by $110 to $990. Alex's scores are 85 (Premise 5) and 92 (Premise 6). The average score, calculated as per Premise 7, is (85+92)/2 = 88.5.

### Example 2 (Researcher Eligibility & Access - Two Yes/No)

Premises:
1. To be eligible for Project Alpha, a researcher must have a PhD AND at least 2 years of research experience.
2. To access the secure lab, a researcher must be eligible for Project Alpha AND have completed security training.
3. Dr. Lee has a PhD.
4. Dr. Lee has 3 years of research experience.
5. Dr. Lee has not completed security training.
6. Dr. Chen has a PhD.
7. Dr. Chen has 1 year of research experience.
8. Dr. Chen has completed security training.

Question:
Is Dr. Lee eligible for Project Alpha, and can Dr. Chen access the secure lab?

Execution:
Step 1: Understand the Question
- First part: Determine Dr. Lee's eligibility for Project Alpha (Yes/No/Uncertain).
- Second part: Determine if Dr. Chen can access the secure lab (Yes/No/Uncertain).

Step 2: Evaluate Dr. Lee's Eligibility for Project Alpha
- Project Alpha requirements (Premise 1): PhD AND 2+ years experience.
- Dr. Lee has a PhD (Premise 3). This meets the first condition.
- Dr. Lee has 3 years of research experience (Premise 4). Since 3 >= 2, this meets the second condition.
- Since both conditions from Premise 1 are met for Dr. Lee (using Premises 3 and 4), Dr. Lee is eligible for Project Alpha.

Step 3: Evaluate Dr. Chen's Access to Secure Lab
- Secure lab access requirements (Premise 2): Eligible for Project Alpha AND completed security training.
- First, check Dr. Chen's eligibility for Project Alpha (using Premise 1 requirements):
    - Dr. Chen has a PhD (Premise 6). This meets the first condition of Premise 1.
    - Dr. Chen has 1 year of research experience (Premise 7). Since 1 < 2, this FAILS to meet the second condition of Premise 1.
    - Therefore, Dr. Chen is NOT eligible for Project Alpha.
- Since Dr. Chen is not eligible for Project Alpha, one of the conditions for secure lab access (Premise 2) is not met.
- Therefore, Dr. Chen cannot access the secure lab.

Final answer: Yes, No
idx: [1,2,3,4,6,7] 
explanation: Dr. Lee is eligible for Project Alpha because they have a PhD (Premise 3) and 3 years of experience (Premise 4), meeting both conditions of Premise 1. Dr. Chen cannot access the secure lab because, while having a PhD (Premise 6), they only have 1 year of experience (Premise 7), failing Project Alpha eligibility (Premise 1), which is a requirement for lab access (Premise 2). Premise 5 and 8 were considered but not critical for these specific conclusions. (Note: idx can be optimized for minimal premises per conclusion. For Dr. Lee: [1,3,4]. For Dr. Chen: [1,2,6,7]. The combined idx includes all touched upon.)

### Example 3 (Faculty Qualifications - Numerical + Yes/No)

Premises:
1. If a faculty member has completed training, they can teach undergraduate courses.
2. If a faculty member can teach undergraduate courses and holds a PhD, they can supervise graduate students.
3. If a faculty member can supervise graduate students and has at least 3 publications, they can serve on curriculum committees.
4. If a faculty member can serve on curriculum committees and has a positive teaching evaluation, they can propose new courses.
5. Professor John has completed pedagogical training.
6. Professor John holds a PhD.
7. Professor John has published at least 3 academic papers.
8. Professor John has received a positive teaching evaluation.

Question:
How many publications does Professor John have, according to the premises, and can he propose new courses?

Execution:
Step 1: Understand the Question
- First part: Determine the number of Professor John's publications (numerical).
- Second part: Determine if Professor John can propose new courses (Yes/No/Uncertain).

Step 2: Determine Number of Publications
- From Premise 7: "Professor John has published at least 3 academic papers." The premise states "at least 3". For a specific number, we can state 3 as the minimum confirmed.

Step 3: Evaluate if Professor John Can Propose New Courses
1. From Premise 5 (John completed training) and Premise 1 (If training, then can teach undergrad):
   - Professor John can teach undergraduate courses. (Modus Ponens)

2. From Step 3.1 (John can teach undergrad), Premise 6 (John holds PhD), and Premise 2 (If teach undergrad and PhD, then can supervise grad):
   - Professor John can supervise graduate students. (Modus Ponens & And Introduction)

3. From Step 3.2 (John can supervise grad), Premise 7 (John has at least 3 publications), and Premise 3 (If supervise grad and 3+ publications, then can serve on committees):
   - Professor John can serve on curriculum committees. (Modus Ponens & And Introduction)

4. From Step 3.3 (John can serve on committees), Premise 8 (John has positive evaluation), and Premise 4 (If serve on committees and positive evaluation, then can propose courses):
   - Professor John can propose new courses. (Modus Ponens & And Introduction)

Final answer: 3, Yes
idx: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
explanation: Premise 7 states Professor John has at least 3 publications. Following the chain of qualifications: Premise 5 and Premise 1 show he can teach undergraduates. This, with Premise 6 (PhD) and Premise 2, allows him to supervise graduate students. Then, with Premise 7 (publications) and Premise 3, he can serve on curriculum committees. Finally, this service, with Premise 8 (positive evaluation) and Premise 4, confirms he can propose new courses.

### Solve the Following

- These are the Context (premises) and the chained question you need to solve:  
   **Context**:  [[CONTEXT]]  

   **Question**: [[QUESTION]]  

- Here is the reasoning plan which you should follow to help solve this problem.  

   **Plan**: [[PLAN]]  

- Make sure you carefully follow the requirements:  
   1. Provide the answer in the format '<number>, Yes/No/Uncertain', where the first part is the numerical answer and the second part is the answer to the conditional question. If the question is about currency, add the currency symbol in front of the <number> 
   2. Use only the information provided in the premises to infer the answers. Do not use any external information or make assumptions not supported by the premises. If some premise is semantically equivalent, such as "love the most" and "favorite", you can consider this as a valid assumption. You can make assumptions about entities if they are obvious but not about logical relationships. For instance, an entity with an obvious human name can be inferred as a human.  
   3. Use logical reasoning based on the premises to derive the answers. Clearly explain your reasoning process in natural language.  
   4. If the second part of the question depends on the first part, ensure that you use the answer from the first part in your reasoning for the second part.  
   5. Clearly indicate which premises you use in each step of your reasoning.  
   6. Explain each step in natural language, referencing the premises used.  
   7. When inferring new knowledge, clearly indicate which premises you used. For example, if you use Premise 1 and a conclusion from a previous step, state "From Premise 1 and the previous conclusion".  
   8. After providing the final answer, include:  
      - "idx": a list of the indices of the premises used in your reasoning, in ascending order without duplicates.
      - "explanation": a brief but detailed natural language explanation (2-6 sentences) summarizing your reasoning process. Clearly mention what premise you use for the answer here.
