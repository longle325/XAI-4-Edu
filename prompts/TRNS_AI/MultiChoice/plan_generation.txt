Given a set of premises and a multiple-choice question, derive a step-by-step plan that uses the premises and logical reasoning to infer new knowledge if needed, in order to determine the correct option. 
Your plan should guide a language model to systematically evaluate each option.

The answer must be one of the provided options (A, B, C, or D). Develop a systematic plan to reason correctly and combine with the corresponding options. You need to reason carefully and logically step by step to get the correct answer.

[[QUESTION]]

After your reasoning, provide the final answer in this format:
    -Final answer: One of the provided options (A, B, C or D)
    -idx: a list of premise indices used, in ascending order without duplicates. The list must avoid Over-inclusion and Under-inclusion.
    -explanation: a brief but detailed natural language explanation summarizing your reasoning process. Clearly mention what premise you use for the answer here.

Below is an example:
###
Premises: 
1. If a Python code is well-tested, then the project is optimized.
2. If a Python code does not follow PEP 8 standards, then it is not well-tested.
3. All Python projects are easy to maintain.
4. All Python code is well-tested.
5. If a Python code follows PEP 8 standards, then it is easy to maintain.
6. If a Python code is well-tested, then it follows PEP 8 standards.
7. f a Python project is well-structured, then it is optimized.
8. If a Python project is easy to maintain, then it is well-tested.
9. If a Python project is optimized, then it has clean and readable code.
10. All Python projects are well-structured.
11. All Python projects have clean and readable code.
12. There exists at least one Python project that follows best practices.
13. There exists at least one Python project that is optimized.
14. If a Python project is not well-structured, then it does not follow PEP 8 standards.

Question: Which conclusion follows with the fewest premises?\nA. If a Python project is not optimized, then it is not well-tested\nB. If all Python projects are optimized, then all Python projects are well-structured\nC. If a Python project is well-tested, then it must be clean and readable\nD. If a Python project is not optimized, then it does not follow PEP 8 standards

Extract answer to output format: 
    -Final answer: A
    -idx: [1]
    -Explanation: Premise 1 states that if a Python project is well-tested, it is optimized. By logical contraposition, if a project is not optimized, it is not well-tested, supporting option A with the fewest premises. Option B is false because optimization does not imply well-structured projects. Option C follows from premises 4, 1, and 9 but requires more steps. Option D follows from premises 1 and 6 but is less direct than A.

Ensure your reasoning uses only the given premises and adheres to the inference rules. If the question involves a conditional statement, treat the antecedent as a premise and prioritize it over conflicting premises.
