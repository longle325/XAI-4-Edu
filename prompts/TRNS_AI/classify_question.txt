Given a single question, carefully assign it to exactly one of five categories:

 - YesNo :
    • Definition: Can be answered with “yes” or “no” alone, without requiring further content or explanation.
    • Phrasing: Typically begins with auxiliary or modal verbs (Is, Are, Do, Does, Did, Can, Could, Will, Would, Should, Have, Has, etc.).
    • Do NOT classify as YesNo if the question explicitly asks for justification (e.g., "..., and why?") or contains multiple parts requiring different answer types beyond a simple confirmation/denial sequence.

 - MultiChoice :
    • Definition: Presents a fixed, explicit set of answer options, usually labeled (e.g., a, b, c, d; i, ii, iii; True/False).
    • Phrasing: Often contains phrases like “Which of the following…?”, “Select the best answer…”, or lists clearly demarcated choices. The presence of explicit labels (a, b, c, etc.) is a strong indicator.
    • Includes single‑answer and select‑all‑that‑apply formats.
    • If choices are presented *without* clear labels (e.g., just listed within a sentence separated by commas or 'or'), carefully consider if the primary task is selection from *that specific list* (classify as MultiChoice) or if it's more open (classify as OpenEnded).
    • Even if an explanation is requested (“Explain your choice”), the presence of predefined, labeled options makes it MultiChoice.

 - OpenEnded: 
    • Definition: Requires a answer involving explanation, description, analysis, interpretation, summary, or a computed result requiring justification or process description (not a single number or numerical value).
    • Phrasing: Often begins with What, Why, How, Explain, Describe, Discuss, Summarize, Analyze, Compare, Contrast, List, Define, etc.
    • Excludes questions where the primary expected answer is just a single number or count (these belong to category Numerical). If a question asks "How" in a way that requires a descriptive process, it's OpenEnded.
    • Includes requests for justifications, elaborations, definitions, lists (when not presented as multiple-choice options), and essay‑style responses.

 - ChainedQuestion:
    • Definition: Contains exactly two distinct, sequential questions within the same input. Both questions must be independently answerable with either Yes/No/Uncertain or a specific numerical value.
    • Phrasing: Often appears as two distinct question sentences, questions joined by conjunctions ('and'), or using markers like 'First... Second...', 'Question 1... Question 2...'.
    • Constraint: Strictly limited to *two* questions, and *both* must be of the simple types specified (Yes/No/Uncertain/Numerical). If either question requires explanation/description (making it Open-Ended), or if there are more than two questions, it does not belong in this category.
    • Priority: If an input meets the criteria for a Chained Question, classify it as ChainedQuestion, even if the individual questions might otherwise fit categories YesNo or Numerical.

 - Numerical: 
    • Definition: Requires a numerical answer, such as a number, amount, value, percentage, time, or date.
    • Phrasing: Typically starts with "How many", "How much", "What is/are the total/average/count/number/percentage/value", "Calculate...", or "When" (for specific time/date).
    • There can be more than one numerical value required for one question.


Edge Cases:
  – Disguised yes/no with explanation: “Can exercise improve memory, and why?” → OpenEnded (due to 'why')
  – Complex multipart yes/no: “Does condition A apply, and if not, does condition B?” → YesNo (still fundamentally Yes/No logic)
  – Question asking for a list without providing options: "What are the planets in our solar system?" → OpenEnded 
  – Question asking to calculate *and* explain: "Calculate the area and explain your steps." → OpenEnded
  – Rhetorical or hypothetical questions follow form: yes/no form → YesNo; option list → MultiChoice; asking "how many" → Numerical; asking "why" or requiring explanation or description → OpenEnded.

Instruction:
  • Analyze the provided question carefully based on the definitions above.
  • Output only the single label corresponding to the assigned category (YesNo, MultiChoice, OpenEnded, ChainedQuestion Numerical).
  • Do NOT include any extra text, punctuation, or explanation in your output.
